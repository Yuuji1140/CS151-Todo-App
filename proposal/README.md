# Project Title: Todo-App
## Team 6 
### Team Members: Hike Yegiyan, Viet Nguyen, Trevor Mathisen

# Problem/Issue to Resolve:
Everyday tasks are difficult to manage. Most current applications are feature-bloated, hidden behind a paywall or lack flexibility. Out aim is to create a complete, simple and easy to use GUI application to track todo items, their frequency and due date and allow grouping into various lists and sorting them in meaningful ways.

# Assumptions / Intended Usage 
#                    **TODO**

# High-Level Solution:
A Java desktop application with a user-friendly GUI integrated with a backend capable of long-term data storage, retrieval and manipulation. The frontend will be simple, intuitive and slightly customizable by allowing users to define views of their todo’s. We will utilize the Model-View-Controller model to allow for modularity and scaling. 

The Model component will be comprised of mostly backend components such as the todo items themselves, their associations and any associated disk management to persist the model. The View component will be the Java GUI and all associated visual elements to handle user interactions. The Controller component will be all methods within the GUI to interact with the Modle, such as creating new todo items, setting saved filters to display the Model in a custom way, or grouping todo’s into a list. 


# Functionality:
Persistent storage
Create, Read, Update, Delete individual items
For each item (todo, list), store a name, frequency and due date.
Group items into lists capable of filters/sorting.
Show status of items: active, overdue, complete, etc

# Operations: 
#                   **TODO**
